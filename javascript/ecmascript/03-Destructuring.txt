Destructuring

Destructuring is a convenient way of extracting multiple values from data stored in arrays or objects into distinct variables.

JavaScript allows constructing arrays / objects, one property at a time or multiple properties at a time.

const name = { first: 'Kim', last: 'Johnson' };
However, extracting data had to be done one property at a time. There was no way to extract multiple properties at a time.

const firstname = name.first;
const lastname = name.last;

Destructuring Arrays
Taking array elements directly into variables:
var [one, two, three, four] = ["chennai", "mumbai", "goa", "cochin"];  
//console.log(one);  => chennai
Skipping values and taking second array element in variable two:
var [,two,,]=["chennai", "mumbai", "goa", "cochin"];
//console.log(two);  => mumbai
Destructuring Nested Arrays:
 const [one, two, three] = [ 1,  [2,3],  [4,5] ];    
//one=> 1 two=> [2,3], three=>[4,5]

Destructuring Objects
In Objects, variables can be skipped using commas.

Example of taking object elements directly into variables:

var {firstName:first,lastName:last,...details}={
        firstName:  "Neha",
        lastName:   "Singh",
        age:     40,
        city:   "chennai",
        phone:   980000000
}

console.log (first , details);
//output: Neha {age: 40, city: "chennai", phone: 980000000}

Destructuring Nested Objects
Declaration below would assign values a = 1, b = 2 and c = { four: 4, five: 5}
const {one: a, two: b, three: c}  = { one: 1, two: 2, three: { four: 4, five: 5} } ;   
For readability we can use one:one instead of one:a. Declaration below would assign:
one = 1, two = 2 and three = { four: 4, five: 5}

const {one: one, two: two, three: three}  = { one: 1, two: 2, three: { four: 4, five: 5} } ;
Similarly, the declaration below will assign:
one = 1, two= 2 and three= 3

const {one, two, three} = { one: 1, two: 2, three: 3 };
Default values can also be used in destructuring
const {one, two, three, four=4} = { one: 1, two: 2, three: 3 };
