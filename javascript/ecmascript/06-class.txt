Class

Class is just syntactical sugar over JavaScript prototype based inheritance.

ES6 classes provide simple and clear syntax for creating objects and deal with inheritance.

Class Definition Includes:
Class Declaration:
class ArithmeticOperations {
    constructor(x, y){
         this.x = x;
         this.y = y;
    }
    multiply() {
         return this.x * this.y;
    }
}                                               
Class Expression:
let ArithmeticOperations = class {
     // same as class definition above
}

Types of Methods
Constructor: is a special method for initializing and creating objects with a class. A class can have at the most one constructor.

Static Methods: are method on constructor function itself. They can be created using static keyword. They cannot be invoked using instances.

Example:

class Food {
  static describe () {
    console.log("Food is a data type for storing macronutrient information.");
  }
}
Food.describe();  
Prototype Methods: are any methods which are not constructor or static method

Inheritance - SubClassing
extends keyword can be used to make a class a subclass(child) of another class.

class ArithmeticOperations{

  constructor(x,y) {

        this.x = x;

        this.y = y;

    }

  multiply() {

        return this.x * this.y;

    }

}

class Addition extends ArithmeticOperations {

    sum() {

        return this.x + this.y;

    }

}

let operation = new Addition(2, 3);

operation.sum();   //  5

operation.multiply(); // 6

Inheritance - SuperClassing
Parent class methods can be invoked using super keyword.

class DoubleAdd extends Addition {
    doubleAdd() {
        return 2 * super.sum();
    }
}
var x = new DoubleAdd(2, 3);
x.doubleAdd();      //  10

Practice Constructor and Static methods
Create a class Point where the constructor takes two integer values and assigns it to two variables x and y.
Create a static method distance which takes two co-ordinates as input and finds the distance between them.
