Maps and Sets
Maps

Maps are objects that associate a key to a value.
Maps allows both primitives and objects as key and value. But object allows only string keys.
Set

It is a collection of unique values.
Values can be primitive or objects.

WeakSet and WeakMap
WeakSet and WeakMap are similar to Set and Map respectively except that:

Values are easily garbage collected in WeakSet or WeakMap.
They cannot be iterated.
Set references are strong pointers, while WeakSet references are weak pointers and vice versa for map.
Accepts only objects as keys, no primitives.
Few methods such as: .values(), .keys, .entries, and .size do not work.
